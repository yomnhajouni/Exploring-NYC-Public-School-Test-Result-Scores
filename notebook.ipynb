There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n\n# Which schools are best for math?\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate total_SAT per school\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\n# Who are the top 10 performing schools?\ntop_10_schools = schools.sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False)[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].head(10)\n\n# Which NYC borough has the highest standard deviation for total_SAT?\nboroughs = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg([\"count\", \"mean\", \"std\"]).round(2)\n\n# Filter for max std and make borough a column\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs[\"std\"] == boroughs[\"std\"].max()]\n\n# Rename the columns for clarity\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"count\": \"num_schools\", \"mean\": \"average_SAT\", \"std\": \"std_SAT\"})\n\n# Optional: Move borough from index to column\nlargest_std_dev.reset_index(inplace=True)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":22,"lastExecutedAt":1728319478814,"lastExecutedByKernel":"b12ed5d6-86e9-4389-b7ef-317b01d0a8e4","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n\n# Which schools are best for math?\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate total_SAT per school\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\n# Who are the top 10 performing schools?\ntop_10_schools = schools.sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False)[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].head(10)\n\n# Which NYC borough has the highest standard deviation for total_SAT?\nboroughs = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg([\"count\", \"mean\", \"std\"]).round(2)\n\n# Filter for max std and make borough a column\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs[\"std\"] == boroughs[\"std\"].max()]\n\n# Rename the columns for clarity\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"count\": \"num_schools\", \"mean\": \"average_SAT\", \"std\": \"std_SAT\"})\n\n# Optional: Move borough from index to column\nlargest_std_dev.reset_index(inplace=True)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"b944a8e4-11b1-485e-acee-5c19ad19230c","outputs":[],"execution_count":25}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
